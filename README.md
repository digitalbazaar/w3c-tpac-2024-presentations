# 2024 W3C TPAC Presentations

## Usage

To create a new presentation, copy `Templates/Overview.html` into a new
directory. Use [`http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) (or
similar) to serve the main repo directory.

```sh
$ http-server . -c -1 # serve without caching
# http://localhost.com:8081
```

Edit the presentation and reload your browser to view new changes.
