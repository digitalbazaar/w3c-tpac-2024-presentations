    <h2>What is a DID Method?</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs),
a W3C Recommendation, are a type of identifier that enables people and
organizations to own their identifiers.
    </p>
    <p>
A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID Method</a> is a
specification describing a protocol for creating, reading, updating, and
deactivating a Decentralized Identifier.
    </p>
    <p>
There are <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-extensions/methods/#did-methods">
over 200 registered DID Methods</a> today! Some say that's great, some say
that's terrible!
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
    <h2>Who uses DIDs?</h2>
    <h3>Production Deployments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
BlueSky (a decentralized social network) provides DIDs for 9 million people (in
production).
      </li>
      <li>
The California DMV provides DIDs for all their Verifiable Credential
Driver's License holders (over 600K people, in production today -- over 34
million people at scale).
      </li>
      <li>
US Citizenship and Immigration Services (DHS USCIS) has committed to using DIDs
for DHS agencies and the 43 million people that hold identity documents issued
by them.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
    <h2>Why Standardize DID Methods?</h2>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Governments are looking for more definitive guidance</li>
      <li>W3C Members are looking for demonstrations of interop</li>
      <li>Did we mention there are over 200 DID Methods? :)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
    <h2>Demonstration of Momentum</h2>
    <h3>Momentum</h3>
    <p>
Recently, the W3C Credentials Community Group, the Decentralized Identity
Foundation, the Trust Over IP Foundation, and the IOTA Foundation announced a
joint initiative to standardize DID Methods. These groups are actively
incubating DID Methods to be standardized.
    </p>

  <section class="slide">
    <h2>Pre-standardization Areas of Focus</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>W3C-bound DID Methods</li>
      <li>Common DID Features (DNS as a 2nd factor, audit logs)</li>
      <li>Cross-standards organization collaboration</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
    <h2>W3C DID Methods Working Group?</h2>
    <h3>A W3C Charter Proposal</h3>
    <p>
Gathering feedback on a
<a href="https://msporny.github.io/w3c-dmwg/">W3C DID Methods Working Group
Charter</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An ephemeral method?</li>
      <li>A web-based method?</li>
      <li>A decentralized method?</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide final">
    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Would there be support for a W3C DID Methods Working Group?</li>
      <li>Would there be objections, if so, what are they?</li>
      <li>Any other thoughts, concerns, or questions?</li>
